    SelfAttention(d, d_k, d_v)

Single-head scaled dot-product self-attention as a Flux layer. Holds three
learnable projection matrices `W_Q`, `W_K`, `W_V` of shape `(d, d_k)`,
`(d, d_k)`, and `(d, d_v)` respectively, where `d` is the input embedding
dimension and `d_k`, `d_v` are the key and value dimensions.

When called as `sa(X, mask)`:

* `X` is a `(d, n, B)` tensor of token embeddings (n = sequence length, B = batch size)
* `mask` is a `(n, B)` `Bool` matrix where `true` marks valid (non-padding) positions

Returns `(output, weights)` where `output` is `(d_v, n, B)` and `weights` is
`(n, n, B)` with `weights[i, j, b]` giving the attention weight from query `i`
to key `j` in batch `b`.

Implements the equation
    softmax( Q Kᵀ / sqrt(d_k) ) V
from the L13a lecture, with key positions corresponding to padding masked out
to large negative scores so they receive zero attention weight.

    (sa::SelfAttention)(X, mask)

Forward pass: compute scaled dot-product self-attention.

Steps:
1. Project X into Q, K, V using the learned weight matrices.
2. Compute attention scores as Q Kᵀ / √d_k.
3. Mask out padding positions by adding a large negative value to their scores.
4. Apply row-wise softmax so each query's weights sum to 1.
5. Compute the output as the weighted sum of value vectors.

Returns `(output, weights)` where:
- `output` is (d_v, n, B): the context-aware representation of each token
- `weights` is (n, n, B): the attention weight matrix (useful for visualization)
